Welcome! I am a Phd candidate in Chemical Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign graduating in December 2021. I am very interested in the development of machine learning approaches to overcome real-world problems in the field of computer vision and image processing. While working as a researcher in analyzing histological images for cancer diagnosis, I gained substantial experience in developing deep learning models for classification, segmentation, object detection, image reconstruction, and image enhancement. Additionally, by collaborating with well-know pathologists in Mayo Clinics and MD-Anderson, I increased my knowledge of histopathology which I believe is helpful to better integrate machine learning in healthcare.
